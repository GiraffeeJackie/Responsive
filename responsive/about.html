                high end brands. We are commited to the customer service we provide and exceeding our
                customers expectations. You can sign up today to become a member and get our weekly newsletters
                that comes with coupon codes that change weekly. You can help save giraffes as well by purchasing
                through Purple Giraffe because 5% of each purchase goes to the 
                Giraffe Conservation Foundation (GCF) to help protect and save the giraffes 
                around the world. With research and help from a chemist, Jacqueline Niemet began developing a small line of nontoxic skincare in 2017, called Purple Giraffe. She named it that after one of her first products, a hydrating face mask.
